# Helix Nebula – Astrophotography by Phillip Comer

This repository documents the capture and processing of my image of the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293), also known as the “Eye of God.” This planetary nebula was captured at **Crow Hill Observatory** using a Seestar S50 and processed entirely by hand using **PixInsight**, with no AI generation or enhancement.
